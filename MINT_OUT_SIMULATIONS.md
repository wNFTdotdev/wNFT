# Derivative Mint-Out Simulation Results

## Overview
These simulations show the complete mint-out process for derivatives at three different price points: LOW (0.1 parent/derivative), MEDIUM (0.5 parent/derivative), and HIGH (1.0 parent/derivative).

## Parent Pool Setup

In each of the below scenarios, we should have a parent pool set up with 300 parent tokens of liquidity and about 2 eth. the liquidity should span from .005 eth per parent token to .15 eth per parent token. the current price should be .01 eth per parent token.

## Results

### LOW PRICE DERIVATIVE (0.1 parent per derivative)

### MEDIUM PRICE DERIVATIVE (0.5 parent per derivative)
**Setup:**
- Max Supply: 100 NFTs
