# Admin Notes

## Vault Versions
- `wNFT` implements the lean V2 primitive. It has **no owner** and exports no admin-only entrypoints. Anyone can deposit NFTs, mint the fungible supply (fixed at `1e18` tokens per NFT), and withdraw against the inventoryâ€”treat it as "WETH for NFTs".
- `MinterwNFT` mirrors the core vault for derivative drops. It pre-mints its token supply to the creator, can mint the associated `wNFTNFT` collection, and still supports deposit/withdraw for secondary liquidity.

## Factories & Ownership
- `wNFTFactory` mirrors the vault's permissionless ethos. It performs deterministic `CREATE2` deployments keyed off the ERC-721 collection and keeps lookup tables, but it does **not** retain an owner role.
- `DerivativeFactory` is the only component that enforces ownership. It owns newly minted `wNFTNFT` derivatives, registers pools on the Uniswap v4 hook, and can optionally hand control to downstream operators. The owner must also hold the hook to satisfy the `requiresHookOwnership` modifier.

## Documentation Sync Checklist
- README now describes the vault as ownerless/permissionless and clarifies that factories introduce ownership only where necessary.
- When adding new modules, update this file and link any privileged operations so operations teams understand which addresses require custody.

*Note*: Legacy migration tooling that interacts with wNFT V1 now lives in the dedicated `wNFTV1Migration` repository.
